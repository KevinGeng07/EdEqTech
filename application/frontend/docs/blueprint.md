## Core Features:

- Address Input with Autocomplete: An input field where users can type an address with Google Maps API-powered autocompletion to suggest valid addresses as the user types.
- Location Data Fetching: Connect to a Python FastAPI backend to retrieve the latitude and longitude coordinates when the user selects an address or submits the typed address.
- Mini-Map Widget: Display a mini-map showing the pinpointed location based on the coordinates obtained from the backend.
- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling for invalid addresses or backend errors.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#4994EC) for a clean, tech-oriented feel.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF4FA), almost white.
- Accent color: Teal (#47A8A6), to complement the primary without overpowering it.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern, neutral, and readable interface.
- Use simple, outline-style map and location icons.
- Keep the layout clean and focused on the map and address input.
- Use smooth transitions for map updates and location display changes.
